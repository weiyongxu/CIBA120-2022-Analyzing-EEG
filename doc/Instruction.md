    - The installer adds menu entries on Linux and Windows, and several application bundles to the Applications folder on macOS.

2. Open Spyder from the memu/application. 

    - You can use Spyder to start writing your own python analysis scripts right away.
    - The example scripts (*.py) provided in this course can be opened form File menu-> Open.
    - Run the entire script/file by clicking the ![](button1.png) button the Toolbar (or press F5 key).
    - Run selection or current line by clicking the  ![](button2.png)  button in the Toolbar (or press F5 key).

# Analyze oddball and imagmove EEG data in MNE Python

## Task 1: Practise the EEG preprocessing step using the oddball data from two participants:
* download the script: **Practise-processing-oddball.py**
* open the script in Spyder
* Follow the detailed instruction in the comments(line started with `#`)
* It is possble to run the entire script or run each line at a time

## Task 2: Run the group analyze script for Oddball task
* download the script: **oddball-group_analysis.py**
* Run the script in Spyder and check the output in the ipyhton terminal and the figure plotted.
* Compare your own results with the demo results in  **oddball-group_analysis.ipynb** (can be opened in Github webpage) or **oddball-group_analysis.html** (need to download and open locally).
## Task 3: Run the group analyze script for ImagMove task
* same steps as in Task 2 but run the script : **ImagMove-group_analysis.py** and compare with corresponding demo results.
